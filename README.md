# E-Placer 🎓🤝  
*A Centralized Community Service Placement Platform for University Students*

## 📌 Project Overview
E-Placer is a web-based platform designed to modernize and streamline how university students discover and apply for community service placements.  
The system replaces inefficient manual processes (PDF lists, phone calls, and physical visits) with a **real-time, digital, and student-centered solution**.

This project was developed in response to a clearly identified problem faced by students at **USIU-Africa**, where securing community service placements is mandatory for graduation but currently handled through outdated methods :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Students are required to complete community service hours but face:
- Outdated placement lists with no live availability
- Repeated calls to already-full organizations
- High stress due to tight placement deadlines
- No centralized system to track applications

E-Placer addresses these challenges through automation, transparency, and real-time updates.
